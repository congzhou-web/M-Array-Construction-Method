## M-Array-Construction-Method

A new method of M-Array construction based on non-zero maps theory.m-array with a large array size and close numbers of rows and columns is
constructed by dividing and splicing m-sequence. Comparing with existing methods, the advantages of the 
algorithm include larger array size, more balanced number of rows and columns, and lower computational 
complexity. If needed, the method in this paper is flexible enough that the number of rows and columns of 
m-array can also be adjusted within a certain range, meaning that m-array with specific rows and columns
ratio can be constructed.
